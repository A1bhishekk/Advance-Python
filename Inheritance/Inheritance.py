# INHERITANCE
# Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or 
# inherit the properties from another(existing) class. 

# Parent class >> Base class or Super class
# Child class >> Derived class or Sub class

# Benefits of inheritance are: 
# It represents real-world relationships well.
# It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write 
# the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more 
# features to a class without modifying it.
# It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits 
# from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically 
# inherit from class A.
